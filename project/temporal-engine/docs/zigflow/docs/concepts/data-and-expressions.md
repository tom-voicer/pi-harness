## What you will learn[​](#what-you-will-learn "Direct link to What you will learn")

*   How data flows through a Zigflow workflow
*   The expression syntax
*   Available variables
*   Built-in functions
*   How `set`, `output.as` and `export.as` interact

## Expressions[​](#expressions "Direct link to Expressions")

Zigflow uses a jq-style expression syntax wrapped in `${ }`.

```
message: ${ $input.name }
```

The expression inside `${ }` is evaluated as a jq filter against the current input. The result replaces the expression value.

Expressions can appear in most YAML values: task properties, output transformations, conditions and export statements.

Bare strings are treated as literal values:

```
message: hello  # literal string "hello"
```

Expressions with string interpolation require quotes:

```
endpoint: ${ "https://api.example.com/users/" + ($data.userId | tostring) }
```

## Variables[​](#variables "Direct link to Variables")

Variable

Description

`$input`

The workflow's input data, as passed by the client

`$context`

The accumulated context from previous `export` calls

`$data`

The data stored by previous `set` tasks

`$env`

Environment variables available to the worker

`$output`

The output of the most recent task

### `$input`[​](#input "Direct link to input")

The data passed in when the workflow execution was started. It is set once and does not change.

```
- greet:    set:      name: ${ $input.userName }
```

### `$data`[​](#data "Direct link to data")

Data stored by `set` tasks. Each `set` task merges its keys into `$data`. Values persist for the remainder of the workflow.

```
- captureId:    set:      userId: ${ $input.userId }- callApi:    call: http    with:      method: get      endpoint: ${ "https://api.example.com/users/" + ($data.userId | tostring) }
```

### `$context`[​](#context "Direct link to context")

The accumulated context built up by `export` statements. Use it to carry structured data forward without polluting `$data`.

```
- step1:    export:      as: ${ $context + { step1Result: . } }    set:      foo: bar
```

### `$env`[​](#env "Direct link to env")

Environment variables available to the worker process. Variables prefixed with `ZIGGY_` (default prefix) are loaded from the environment and accessible without the prefix.

```
- readConfig:    set:      apiUrl: ${ $env.API_BASE_URL }
```

Set `--env-prefix` to change the prefix (default is `ZIGGY`).

### `$output`[​](#output "Direct link to output")

The output of the most recently completed task. Use it to chain task results without storing them explicitly.

## Built-in functions[​](#built-in-functions "Direct link to Built-in functions")

These functions are available inside `${ }` expressions:

Function

Returns

Notes

`uuid`

Random UUID v4

Must be used inside a `set` task for determinism

`timestamp`

Unix timestamp (integer)

Must be used inside a `set` task for determinism

`timestamp_iso8601`

ISO 8601 timestamp string

Must be used inside a `set` task for determinism

### Why must generated values be in a `set` task?[​](#why-must-generated-values-be-in-a-set-task "Direct link to why-must-generated-values-be-in-a-set-task")

Temporal replays workflow history. If you generate a UUID inside an HTTP call body, a different UUID is generated on replay. Temporal detects this as non-determinism and raises an error.

The `set` task wraps generated values in a Temporal side-effect, which records the value in the history so it is stable across replays.

```
# Bad: UUID differs on replay- callApi:    call: http    with:      method: post      body:        requestId: ${ uuid }  # Different value on replay# Good: UUID is stable across replays- generateId:    set:      requestId: ${ uuid }- callApi:    call: http    with:      method: post      body:        requestId: ${ $data.requestId }
```

## Output and export[​](#output-and-export "Direct link to Output and export")

Two properties control what a task passes forward:

### `output.as`[​](#outputas "Direct link to outputas")

Transforms the task's output before it is passed to the next task. The expression is evaluated against the raw task output.

```
- getUser:    call: http    output:      as:        userId: ${ .id }        name: ${ .name }    with:      method: get      endpoint: https://api.example.com/users/1
```

### `export.as`[​](#exportas "Direct link to exportas")

Saves the task's (optionally transformed) output into `$context`. This is how you accumulate data across multiple tasks.

```
- step1:    export:      as: ${ $context + { result: . } }    set:      value: 42
```

### Combining them[​](#combining-them "Direct link to Combining them")

`output.as` runs first, then `export.as` runs against the transformed output.

* * *

Inside workflow execution, metadata is accessible via `$data.workflow` and `$data.activity`:

```
- logAttempt:    set:      attempt: ${ $data.workflow.attempt }      workflowId: ${ $data.workflow.workflow_execution_id }
```

## Common mistakes[​](#common-mistakes "Direct link to Common mistakes")

**Using `uuid` or `timestamp` outside a `set` task.** This causes a Non-Determinism Error on workflow replay. Always generate values in a `set` task and reference them via `$data`.

**Accessing `$data.key` before the `set` task that defines it.** `$data` keys are only available after the `set` task that created them has run. Access them in a later task.

**Confusing `$output` with `$data`.** `$output` is the output of the last task only. `$data` accumulates across `set` tasks.
